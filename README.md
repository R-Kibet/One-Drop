## Description
**The application**

Will help us to:

1. Create a buyer or seller profile
2. Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) via the UI
3. Store products to mongodb server

In this case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our application:
#As Admin/Seller
* Create a new product
* Retrieve an product from a database etcâ€¦
* Update attributes of the product
* Delete the product
* Viewing Orders
* Changing Order Status
* Viewing Total Earnings
* Viewing Category Based Earnings (on Graph)

#AS Consumer
* Create your own cart
* Retrieve an product from a database
* Update the products on you cart
* Delete the product on your cart

* The application will automatically do the stats of your cart.
